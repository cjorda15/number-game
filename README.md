This is a folder contains files that together create the Numbers Guesser Game. It contains 1 main html file, 1 css file, and
3 javascript files, one of which is linked to the html file.

I was motivated to make this to achieve the comp given.

To play this game, get the index.html, stylesheet.css,
and script.js into one folder. Once in one folder together,
open your terminal and navigate to the folder containing these files.
Once there, type in the terminal open index.html and have fun!

Most simple testing has been done.
